Description
"best programming for web and object oriented coding technique"
"structured queries based programming to get tabular format data and having functional knowledge, database instance"
"We are all familiar with this expression. It especially applies when trying to explain the insight obtained from the analysis of increasingly large datasets. Data visualization plays an essential role in the representation of both small and large-scale data.  One of the key skills of a data scientist is the ability to tell a compelling story, visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way."
"This course teaches learners how to write a program in the Data Structures language, including how to set up a development environment for writing and debugging C++ code and how to implement data structures as C++ classes. It is the first course in the Accelerated CS Fundamentals specialization, and subsequent courses in this specialization will be using C++ as the language for implementing the data structures covered in class."
"Welcome to our course on Object Oriented Programming in Java using data visualization. People come to this course with many different goals -- and we are really excited to work with all of you! Some of you want to be professional software developers, others want to improve your programming skills to implement that cool personal project that you have been thinking about, while others of you might not yet know why you are here and are trying to figure out what this course is all about." 
"In this course, we'll look at the language, and how it supports the Object-Oriented pattern, with a focus on the unique aspect of how web approaches OO. We'll explore a brief introduction to the jQuery library, which is widely used to do in-browser manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling."
"Welcome to this project-based course on Analyzing Box Office Data with Plotly and Python. In this course, you will be working with the The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. "
"In this course you will learn to write retrieval queries using dbms. Retrieving data from a relational database is one of the primary methods used by application and web developers to display data and populate web pages. Since a database can be made up of a complex combination of relational tables, retrieving that data can be challenging. You can meet those challenges by gaining experience with some of the more DBMS coding techniques."
"In this project you will create an application that yields a zodiac sign based on an input of birth month and day. The process of making decisions is fundamental in programming, just as it is in real life. A pre-existing condition is evaluated, and a decision is made based on the evaluation. For example, if it is cold outside, a person chooses to wear a coat. If a temperature sensor exceeds a certain threshold, the furnace turns off. In C++, as in other programming languages, a decision construct is used to control the sequence of instructions that are executed under certain conditions. It allows the programmer the power to take certain action based on various input conditions. For example, a grading program will need to assign a certain grade based on a test score.   Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We are currently working on providing the same experience in other regions."
"Unity to learn about directly manipulating certain properties of GameObjects, including color, scale and position. In a simple space environment, you'll calculate distances between objects to derive color, use random numbers to teleport, and use Unity's physics engine to engage gravity and make objects bouncy!  This Unity guided project is focused on C# coding."
